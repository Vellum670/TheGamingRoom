# Project Overview
Client: The Gaming Room
Project: Software Design for Draw It or Lose It

The Gaming Room is a digital gaming company focused on interactive and engaging user experiences. They requested a software design to transition their Android game, Draw It or Lose It, into a web-based application compatible across multiple platforms. Key requirements included support for real-time multiplayer functionality, team and player management, and robust security for user data in a distributed environment.

Reflection on the Documentation Process
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I excelled at organizing the document for clarity, structuring each section to address core components—such as operating platform recommendations, storage and memory management, distributed systems, and security—tailored to the client’s specific requirements. This organization made the document accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document acted as a strategic roadmap, clarifying the objectives and structure of each system component, ensuring that every part of the application aligned with the client’s needs. This pre-coding structure allowed for a more efficient and organized development process.

What would you pick if you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one section, it would be the distributed systems and networking portion. I would expand on specific networking protocols and further detail load-balancing techniques to make this section more comprehensive and aligned with scalability needs.

How did you interpret and implement the user’s needs into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on scalability, security, and usability, vital for a multiplayer game like Draw It or Lose It. Addressing these needs ensures that the application delivers a reliable, seamless experience, and a focus on user-centered design makes the software intuitive and satisfying for players.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach to this design used object-oriented principles and the Singleton pattern to manage game instances. In the future, I will continue to apply object-oriented principles and structured frameworks, like UML diagrams, to visualize system interactions. I would also emphasize modularity and scalability in design to create flexible, adaptable software solutions.
